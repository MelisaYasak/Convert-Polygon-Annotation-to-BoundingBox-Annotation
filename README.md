# Convert-Polygon-Annotation-to-BoundingBox-Annotation

# Polygon to YOLO Bounding Box Converter

## 📝 Description
This Python tool converts polygon annotations to YOLO format bounding boxes and provides visualization capabilities. It's specifically designed for computer vision and machine learning projects that require format conversion between polygon coordinates and YOLO-style bounding boxes.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Convert polygon coordinates to YOLO format bounding boxes
- Visualize bounding boxes on original images
- Save annotations in YOLO format
- Professional logging system
- Error handling and validation
- Object-oriented design
- Type hints for better code maintenance
